            We are a group of dreamers that came together in order to solve the growing polution problem. Most of the trash in the ocean 
            is plastic, and they end up in the ocean because people litter on beaches, and when the tise rises, trash is swept away into the ocean.
            Plastic isnt biodegradable, meaning it will never fully go away. This means that when it breaks down, it will create microplastics that 
            leach into the earth and ocean. These microplastics get introduced to the food chain when small microbacteria and animals, such as plankton and shrimp, injest it.
            This can cause bigger animals to not get the nutrients they need when they eat these smaller animals, weaking havoc in the food chain.

        How we plan to help
    </h1>
    <div class="card text-white bg-success mb-3">
        <div class="card-body">
            In order to tackle this, we decided to Design a robot that was able to take trash from the sand, no matter
            how big or small it may be. We took inspiration from the Ocean Cleanup interceptorâ„¢, which collects trash from rivers around the world. However,
            beaches still need to be cleaned up, so we decided to make our own robot, the Sandrunner. With it, we hope
            to slowly, but surely, clean up the world's beaches. With 80% of trash on beaches being plastic, however, we
            needed a way to make sure that the plastic we collected would not end up on beaches again. So, we decided to
            partner with Waste to Wear, a company that converts used plastics into clothes for people. We intend to donate a piece of
            clothing to homeless shelters for each piece bought, helping people get back on their feet.
